## What We're Building

DMN provides open-source infrastructure for peer meditation groups.

**Not a meditation app. Not a spiritual organization. Not a business.**

**Infrastructure** - protocols, tools, systems that help people practice together sustainably.

## The Gap We're Filling

### Solo Practice Is Hard to Sustain
- 90% of people who start meditating quit within 6 months
- Willpower alone insufficient
- No accountability
- Feels isolating

### Drop-In Classes Don't Create Depth
- No commitment required = shallow engagement
- Different people every week = no group coherence
- Transactional relationship
- Can't build on previous sessions

### Teacher-Led Practice Has Limitations
- **Teachers provide value:** Technique instruction, correction, wisdom transmission
- **But:** Can create dependency if not balanced with peer practice
- **Groups need:** Both teaching (for technique) AND peer practice (for sustainability)
- **DMN fills the peer infrastructure gap** that complements teacher-led learning

**Teachers are welcome to:**
- Train node facilitators (outside sessions)
- Offer periodic intensives (separate from weekly practice)
- Provide troubleshooting support (remote)
- Participate as peers (during sessions - not as teachers)

**During DMN sessions:**
- Protocol is the teacher, not any person
- All participants are peers (including experienced practitioners)
- Teachers participate through practice, not instruction

### Existing Infrastructure Assumes Hierarchy
- All meditation infrastructure assumes teacher-student model
- No protocols for peer-facilitated groups
- No tools for distributed networks
- Organizations centralize control

**We're building the missing piece: peer-to-peer meditation infrastructure.**

## Our Solution

### 1. Peer Structure
**Everyone equal:**
- No teachers or gurus during sessions
- Facilitation rotates among members
- No authority positions
- Decisions made collectively

**Experienced practitioners:**
- Participate as peers (not teachers)
- Act as field anchors/amplifiers through practice
- Support through presence, not instruction

**Why this works:**
- Prevents dependency
- Distributes responsibility
- Builds autonomy
- Resilient (doesn't collapse if one person leaves)

### 2. Weekly Commitment
**Regular practice, long-term:**
- Same time, same place, every week
- Commitment to the group (not just yourself)
- Build on previous sessions
- Depth emerges over months/years

### 3. Heart-Centered Practice
**Compassion meditation (research-validated):**
- Self-compassion
- Loved ones
- Gratitude
- Silent integration

**Based on research:**
- Heart-brain coherence effects
- Heart rate variability synchronization
- Positive emotions enhance coherence
- Group practice amplifies individual effects

**Technique:**
- Heart-centered breathing (generic, research-backed)
- Mixed affirmation/intention phrases
- Framework-neutral (accessible to all)

### 4. Open Source
**Everything public and forkable:**
- Protocols documented on GitHub
- Tools are open-source code
- Anyone can adapt/modify
- No proprietary methods

### 5. Distributed Network
**Autonomous nodes, not centralized organization:**
- Each node operates independently
- Nodes connect horizontally (peer-to-peer)
- No central authority
- Network resilient to single points of failure

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based
**We measure what works:**
- Track participation and retention
- Collect practitioner feedback
- Partner with researchers
- Publish findings openly
- Adapt based on data

### 2. Accessibility First
**Free and open to all:**
- No fees for protocols or tools
- No prerequisites or requirements
- No spiritual beliefs needed
- Works across cultures and backgrounds

### 3. Integrity Over Growth
**We prioritize:**
- Maintaining peer structure (even if limits growth)
- Protocol quality (over rapid expansion)
- Existing node stability (over launching new ones)
- Long-term sustainability (over short-term metrics)

### 4. Transparency
**Everything visible:**
- All code on GitHub (public)
- All protocols documented (open)
- All data shared (when possible)
- All decisions explained

## What Success Looks Like

### Individual Level
- Sustained practice (2+ years, not 2 months)
- Improved emotional regulation (self-reported + validated)
- Increased compassion (behavioral measures)
- Better stress management
- Enhanced well-being

### Group Level
- Node survives founder leaving
- Rotating facilitation works
- Peer structure maintained
- No guru dynamics emerge
- Collective field develops

### Network Level
- Self-organizing without central control
- Protocols improve through community feedback
- Tools adopted and adapted widely
- Network grows through demonstration

### Research Level
- Published studies validate approach
- Collective effects measurable
- Contributes to meditation science
- Evidence-based best practices emerge

## Research Foundations

**DMN practice builds on established research:**

### Heart-Brain Coherence Research
- Heart-centered focus creates measurable physiological coherence
- Heart rate variability (HRV) synchronizes with breathing patterns
- Coherent state associated with ~5-6 breaths per minute
- Positive emotions (gratitude, compassion) enhance coherence
- Group meditation shows synchronized HRV patterns

**Key findings:**
- Heart generates body's strongest electromagnetic field
- Heart rhythm patterns affect cognitive and emotional function
- Coherent heart rhythms correlate with improved well-being
- Collective coherence measurable in group settings

- Lehrer, P. M., & Gevirtz, R. (2014). Heart rate variability biofeedback...
- Tiller, W. A., et al. (1996). Cardiac coherence: A new measure...

### Compassion Meditation Research
- Increases empathy and prosocial behavior (neuroscience)
- Reduces stress and improves well-being (clinical studies)
- Develops emotional regulation (psychology)
- Reduces implicit bias (social psychology)

- Klimecki et al. (2013) - Differential brain responses
- Weng et al. (2013) - Compassion training alters altruism
- Jazaieri et al. (2013) - Enhancing compassion (review)

### Collective Coherence (Emerging)
- Group meditation synchronizes brain activity (EEG)
- Heart rate variability coherence across participants
- Field effects in meditation groups
- Further research needed (DMN contribution)

## Comparison: DMN vs. Alternatives

| Aspect | DMN | Apps | Teacher Groups | Drop-in Classes |
|--------|-----|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Structure | Peer-to-peer | Individual | Teacher-led | Instructor-led |
| Cost | Free | $10-20/mo | Varies | $15-30/session |
| Commitment | Weekly | None | Varies | None |
| Community | Stable group | None | Sangha | Rotating |
| Teaching | Protocol-guided | Recorded | Live instruction | Class format |
| Best For | Sustained practice | Flexibility | Learning technique | Sampling styles |

**Each serves different needs. DMN fills the peer infrastructure gap.**

**Optimal: Learn from teachers, practice with peers.**

## Who This Is For

### ✅ DMN Works Well If You:
- Want regular meditation with accountability
- Prefer peer relationships over teacher-student
- Can commit to weekly practice long-term
- Are comfortable with minimal instruction
- Value community and collective practice
- Willing to take responsibility for own practice

### ❌ DMN Probably Isn't Right If You:
- Want extensive teacher guidance
- Prefer drop-in flexibility
- Need therapeutic processing
- Want quick results or peak experiences
- Require spiritual teachings or path
- Prefer centralized organization with clear leadership

**Both approaches valid. Choose what fits.**

## For Teachers and Experienced Practitioners

**How you can support DMN:**

**Outside sessions (appropriate):**
- Train node facilitators in technique basics
- Answer protocol questions
- Offer troubleshooting (remotely)
- Lead separate intensives for practitioners
- Research collaboration

**During sessions (inappropriate):**
- Teaching or instructing
- Correcting others
- Taking authority position
- Modifying protocol

**If you participate in a node:**
- Practice as peer (not teacher)
- Follow protocol exactly
- Rotate facilitation like everyone
- Serve as anchor/amplifier through presence
- Your restraint is your contribution

**The protocol is the teacher. You are a practitioner.**

## Our Commitment

**We commit to:**
- Maintaining peer structure (always)
- Keeping everything open-source (free forever)
- Following evidence (not dogma)
- Supporting node autonomy (distributed control)
- Building for long-term (generational thinking)

**We will never:**
- Create hierarchy or authority positions
- Charge for access or protocols
- Centralize control
- Require beliefs
- Prioritize growth over integrity
