## General Questions

### What is the Distributed Meditation Network?

An open-source registry of peer meditation groups worldwide. Think of it as infrastructure for coordinating meditation practice without centralization, fees, or hierarchy.

### Is this a religion or spiritual organization?

No. It's a practice network with a simple protocol. No beliefs required. The practice is secular and based on heart-centered compassion meditation.

### Who runs the DMN?

No one and everyone. It's an open-source project coordinated via GitHub. Anyone can contribute, propose changes, or fork the project.

### Is it really free?

Yes. Completely free. No fees, donations, memberships, or hidden costs. This is a hard requirement for all nodes.

### Do I need meditation experience to participate?

No. Beginners are welcome. The Heart Protocol is simple and requires no prior experience.

## About the Protocol

### Why "Heart Protocol" specifically?

Heart-centered compassion practices have:
- Strong research support
- Simple, accessible technique
- Secular framework
- Universal applicability
- Low barrier to entry

It's effective without being dogmatic.

### Can I add other practices?

DMN nodes specifically practice the Heart Protocol. If you want to combine it with other practices, that's fine for your personal practice, but DMN sessions should stick to the protocol.

You're welcome to start a separate group for other practices.

### What if I practice a different meditation tradition?

That's wonderful. DMN isn't claiming to be the only valid practice. It's simply offering shared infrastructure for this specific peer-based approach.

Practice what works for you. Join DMN sessions if the protocol resonates.

### Can we modify the protocol?

Core elements are non-negotiable:
- Heart-centered focus
- Compassion practice
- Peer structure
- No fees
- Secular approach

Adaptable elements:
- Session length
- Exact timing of phases
- Verbal guidance style
- Sharing format

### Why no teachers?

Teachers create hierarchy. Hierarchy creates dependency. Dependency undermines autonomy. We're exploring what's possible with pure peer structure.

This isn't anti-teacher. It's pro-peer.

## Node Questions

### How do I find a node near me?

Check the [Node Directory](/nodes/). You can search by location, filter by type (physical/virtual), and see session schedules.

### What if there's no node in my area?

Start one! See [Getting Started]({{< ref "getting-started.md" >}}). You don't need special qualifications - just commitment to the protocol and peer structure.

### Can I visit multiple nodes?

Absolutely. All nodes are open to visitors. You're a peer everywhere.

### What's expected of me at a session?

- Arrive on time
- Practice in silence
- Follow the protocol
- Optional: share briefly if there's a sharing circle
- Help with simple tasks if asked (optional)

### How do nodes handle facilitation without a teacher?

Facilitation tasks (ringing bells, reading minimal guidance) rotate among participants. These are service roles, not authority positions.

### What if someone tries to teach or dominate?

Gently redirect to the protocol. If it continues, the person may not be a good fit for peer practice. The network is specifically non-hierarchical.

## Technical Questions

### Do I need a GitHub account?

Helpful but not required. You can:
- Register a node via email
- Browse the directory without an account
- Participate in sessions without any online presence

GitHub is used for coordination, not gatekeeping.

### How is the directory generated?

Automatically via GitHub Actions. When node YAML files are updated, the directory rebuilds and deploys to GitHub Pages.



### Can I use the tools for other purposes?

Yes! Everything is MIT licensed. Fork it, adapt it, use it for your own projects.

### What if the GitHub repo goes away?

Fork it! The entire network can be replicated from any fork. That's the beauty of decentralization.

## Privacy & Safety

### Do I have to share my full address?

No. Node registrations only require general area or landmark. Exact addresses can be shared privately with attendees.

### What about safety for in-person meetings?

- Meet in public or semi-public spaces initially
- Use video conferencing for first contact if preferred
- Trust your instincts
- Bring a friend to first session if more comfortable

### Is my personal information shared?

Only what you put in the node YAML file. You control what's public.

### What if someone behaves inappropriately?

- Address it in the moment if safe
- Mark the node as "paused" in YAML file
- Report to GitHub if it's a network-level issue
- You can always start a new node

## Philosophical Questions

### Isn't meditation better with a teacher?

That's one valid approach. DMN explores a different approach: peer practice.

Both can coexist. Choose what works for you.

### How do beginners learn without instruction?

- The Heart Protocol document provides structure
- Peers can share experiences (not teach)
- The practice is simple enough to learn by doing
- Stumbling is part of learning

We're questioning whether the teacher dependency is necessary.

### Won't this lead to people doing it "wrong"?

There's no wrong. There's the protocol, and there's everything else.

If someone follows the protocol, they're doing it "right." If they want to do something else, they can start a different group.

### What about deepening practice?

Depth comes from:
- Consistent practice
- Sincere effort
- Peer support
- Personal inquiry

Not necessarily from teachers. DMN is testing this hypothesis.

### Aren't you just against spiritual teachers?

Not at all. We respect teachers and teaching lineages.

We're simply exploring: what happens when we remove that element entirely? What becomes possible in a pure peer structure?

It's an experiment in practice infrastructure.

## Participation Questions

### Can I start multiple nodes?

Yes, but consider whether you can maintain them all. Better to have one consistent node than three sporadic ones.

### What if I want to stop my node?

Update your node YAML file:
- Status: "paused" (temporary break)
- Status: "archived" (permanently closed)

That's it. No judgment. Life changes.

### Can organizations/businesses run nodes?

If they:
- Follow the protocol
- Maintain peer structure
- Charge no fees
- Don't use it for marketing/recruitment

Then yes. But the moment it becomes commercial or hierarchical, it's not a DMN node.

### What about meditation apps/startups using DMN?

MIT license allows this. However:
- They can't claim official affiliation
- Nodes that charge fees can't be in the registry
- Commercial entities can't change the core protocol for DMN nodes

## Troubleshooting

### My node isn't showing in the directory

- Check your YAML file for syntax errors
- Ensure your PR was merged
- Wait 10 minutes for rebuild
- Check GitHub Actions logs

### I can't edit my node details

Submit a new PR updating your YAML file. Changes take effect after merge.

### The timer tool isn't working

- Check browser compatibility
- Try different browser
- Report issue on GitHub
- Use a simple timer app as backup

### How do I report a bug or suggest a feature?

- Open a GitHub issue
- Join GitHub Discussions
- Submit a pull request

## Future Questions

### Where is DMN heading?

Wherever the community takes it. There's no roadmap dictated from above. This is peer infrastructure.

Possible directions:
- More tools (scheduling, session recording)
- Mobile app
- Integration with other open-source projects
- Research partnerships

All proposals are welcome.

### Will DMN ever charge fees or monetize?

No. The core repository and protocol are free forever (MIT license).

Individual contributors might create commercial tools around DMN (apps, books, etc.), but the network itself remains free.

### Can DMN scale globally?

That's the experiment. Distributed, peer-based coordination at scale.

We'll find out together.
