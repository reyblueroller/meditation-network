#### 1. Evidence-Based Data Collection
We collect anonymous usage data via Google Analytics to measure the growth of collective coherence. This includes:
* **Network Retention**: Measuring how often practitioners engage with the protocol over time.
* **Node distribution**: Tracking general geographic participation to map the global network.

#### 2. Practitioner Privacy
* **No Personal Logs**: We do not store transcripts, audio, or personal reflections from your meditation sessions.
* **Client-Side Tools**: The Synchronized Timer and Map tools run locally in your browser to protect your identity.

#### 3. Third-Party Infrastructure
We utilize GitHub for node registration to leverage their existing security frameworks. Your registration is a public commitment to the network's transparency.
