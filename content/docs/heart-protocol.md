# Heart Protocol

The Heart Protocol is the core meditation practice of the Distributed Meditation Network.

## Principles

1. **Heart-centered** - Focus attention in the heart area
2. **Compassion-based** - Cultivate loving-kindness for all beings
3. **Peer structure** - No teachers, no students, only practitioners
4. **Secular** - No religious dogma or beliefs required
5. **Simple** - Accessible to beginners and experienced meditators

## Practice Structure

### Basic Session (60 minutes)

   - Close eyes or soft gaze downward
   - Take a few deep breaths

2. **Heart Focus (20 minutes)**
   - Bring attention to the physical heart area
   - Notice sensations, warmth, or energy

3. **Compassion Expansion (25 minutes)**
   - Generate feeling of warmth/kindness in heart

   - Extend to difficult people
   - Extend to all beings

4. **Integration (5 minutes)**
