# About the Builder

**Background:** Platform engineer with 30 years in distributed systems architecture.

**Why This Exists:**

I saw a gap: meditation apps are isolating, teacher-led groups create dependency, 
and no peer infrastructure exists for sustainable group practice.

As someone who builds distributed systems professionally, I approached this as 
an infrastructure problem:

- Can peer meditation work without teachers?
- Can distributed networks scale meditation practice?
- Can open-source protocols replace proprietary methods?

DMN is testing those questions.

**My Role:**

Building infrastructure. Not teaching meditation. Not leading a movement.

I'm testing protocols myself (starting solo January 2026), documenting the process, 
and making everything open-source so others can replicate.

**What I'm NOT:**
- Not a meditation teacher
- Not enlightened or advanced
- Not building a following

**What I AM:**
- Engineer applying systems thinking to practice infrastructure
- Testing protocols in real conditions
- Building in public with full transparency
