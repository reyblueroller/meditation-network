## 00:00 - 05:00 | Arrival & Grounding
(Voice starts softly, as if speaking to a friend)

"Let’s begin. Wherever you are, find a position that feels stable. We aren’t looking for perfection, just a posture that allows your breath to move without restriction. 

Gently close your eyes, or simply soften your gaze toward the floor. 

For the next few minutes, we are just arriving. Notice the weight of your body against the chair or the floor. Notice the temperature of the air. We are shifting from 'doing' to 'being.' 

Take a deep breath in... hold for a second... and let it out with a sigh. 

We aren't trying to change anything yet. We are simply acknowledging that this node is now active. You are part of a distributed network, breathing in sync with peers across the globe."

(Tone becomes slightly more focused, rhythmic)

"Now, let’s move our attention to the center of the chest—the heart space. 

Imagine your breath is flowing in and out of your heart. Slow it down. Breathe a little deeper than usual. 

(Pause 10 seconds)

As we breathe through the heart, we begin to generate a steady frequency. This isn't a feeling we have to force; it’s a state of coherence we are allowing to emerge. 

Think of a feeling of simple appreciation. Not for anything complex—just the feeling of a warm sun, a quiet room, or the breath itself. Radiate that feeling into the center of this room. 

If your mind wanders, that’s fine. That’s just background noise. Gently bring it back to the pulse in your chest. In... and out. Stable
