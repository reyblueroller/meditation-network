# Code of Conduct: Distributed Meditation Network

## 🟢 Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and node operators pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## 🟢 Our Standards
* **Focus on Coherence:** We prioritize the shared frequency of the network over individual ideologies.
* **Peer-to-Peer Respect:** We acknowledge no central "guru." Every node operator is a peer.
* **Neutrality:** We keep the field clear of political, commercial, or religious proselytizing.
* **Privacy:** We respect the anonymity of participants at local nodes.

## 🟢 Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
