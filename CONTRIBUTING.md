# Contributing to the DMN

Welcome! We are building the infrastructure for global stabilization, and we need your help. You don't need to be a coder to contribute.

### 📍 How You Can Help

2. **Improve Protocols:** Have ideas for the AI scripts or the "Silent Pulse" duration? Open a thread in the **Ideas** Discussion category.
3. **Documentation:** Help us translate our guides into other languages to reach more nodes.
4. **Data:** Share your [Field Reports](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/discussions/categories/field-reports) after every session.

### 🛠 Technical Contributions
