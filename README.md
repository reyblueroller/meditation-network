# 🌐 Distributed Meditation Network (DMN)

> **The open-source operating system for planetary coherence.**

The DMN is a decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure designed to stabilize the human collective field. We provide the protocols and coordination tools for autonomous "stabilization nodes" to activate across the globe.

## ⚡️ Quick Start
- **[📍 Find a Node](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/discussions/categories/node-coordination)** – Connect with local or virtual practice threads.
- **[🚀 Register a Node](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/issues/new?template=node_registration.yml)** – Official self-initiation for new physical or digital nodes.
- **[🔊 Get the Protocol](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/blob/infrastructure/protocols/scripts/universal.md)** – Access the AI-synchronized "Relatable Peer" scripts.
- **[📝 Submit Field Report](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/discussions/new?category=field-reports)** – Log your session data after a pulse.

## 🟢 The Mission: 2027 Pulse
We are currently in the **Infrastructure Phase**. Our goal is to establish a resilient mesh network of 100+ nodes leading up to the **March 20, 2027 (Spring Equinox)** global synchronization event.

### Why Peer-to-Peer?
Traditional models rely on central figures. The DMN uses **Shared Protocols** and **GitHub Coordination** to ensure that if one node goes offline, the network remains stable. You are not "joining" a group; you are "initializing" a node.

## 🛠 Repository Structure
- **`/.github`**: Contains the logic for node registration and field reporting.
- **`/protocols`**: The core "Operating System" scripts and audio guidance.
- **`/docs`**: Technical guides for facilitators and audio setup.

## 👋 How to Contribute
1. **Host:** Download the script, grab a Bluetooth speaker, and start a local node.
2. **Research:** Help us refine the science of coherence in the [Research Category](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/discussions/categories/research).
3. **Code:** Improve our node mapping or automation tools.

**The network is forming. The field is stable. Welcome home.**
