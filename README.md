# Distributed Meditation Network (DMN)

> **The open-source operating system for collective human resonance.**

The DMN is a decentralized infrastructure movement. We provide the protocols and the coordination layer for peers to establish autonomous "stabilization nodes" across the planet. We have moved beyond the era of gurus and top-down hierarchies into a model of shared, peer-led coherence.

## 🌐 Network Dashboard
- **[📍 Find a Node](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/discussions/categories/node-coordination)** – Connect with existing local or virtual practices.
- **[🚀 Register a Node](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/issues/new?template=node_registration.yml)** – Self-initiate a new stabilization point in your city.
- **[🔊 Get the Audio](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/tree/main/protocols/audio)** – Download the AI-synchronized "Relatable Peer" protocols.

## 🟢 The Mission
Our goal is to stabilize the human collective field. By practicing the same **Heart Protocol** at the same time across different nodes, we create a distributed mesh network of calm and coherence.

### Why Infrastructure?
Old models of spiritual growth are fragile. By using open-source protocols and GitHub-based coordination, the DMN is resilient, transparent, and belongs to no one but the peers who show up.

## 🛠 The Three Frequencies
We operate on three functional layers to ensure systemic stability:

1. **Structure (Andromedan):** The P2P architecture and open-source protocols.
2. **Heart (Pleiadean):** The grounded compassion generated within the 30-minute practice.
3. **Field (Arcturian):** The collective resonance that bridges nodes across space and time.

## 🕊 The Heart Protocol (v1.0)
Every node runs a standard 30-minute session. We use AI-generated audio with a **"Relatable Peer"** voice to ensure consistency and remove the ego of a central teacher.

- **Zero Barrier:** No special training needed.
- **Neutral:** No religious or complex jargon.
- **Plug-and-Play:** Facilitators simply play the audio for the group.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Sovereignty
To protect our peers, all coordination happens here on **GitHub**.
- **No Data Mining:** We avoid proprietary social media and chat apps.
- **Self-Initiated:** There is no "leader" to join. You align with the mission and initiate your own participation.
- **No Pledges:** We do not require oaths or obligations. You show up because the practice supports your own stability.

---

## 📅 Roadmap: The 2027 Pulse
We are currently in the **Foundation Phase**.
- **2026:** Establishing the first 100 autonomous nodes.
- **March 20, 2027 (Spring Equinox):** The first **Global Synchronous Pulse**. All nodes will activate the protocol simultaneously to demonstrate planetary coherence.

## 👋 Get Involved
1. **Explore:** Read the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md).
2. **Listen:** Sample the [Audio Protocols](./protocols/audio).
3. **Initiate:** Open a [New Node Issue](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/issues/new?template=node_registration.yml) to put your location on the map.

**The network is forming. The field is stable. Welcome home.**
