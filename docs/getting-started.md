# Getting Started

How to join or start a meditation node in the Distributed Meditation Network.

## Joining an Existing Node

### 1. Find a Node

Browse the [Node Directory](directory.html) to find nodes:
- Near your location (physical nodes)
- In your timezone (virtual nodes)
- With schedule that fits yours

### 2. Make Contact

- Use the contact method listed (email, Signal, Matrix)
- Introduce yourself briefly
- Ask about attending the next session
- Mention if you're new to meditation

### 3. Attend a Session

- Arrive 5-10 minutes early for first session
- Bring meditation cushion or use chair
- Expect silence and simplicity
- No pressure to share or participate beyond sitting

### 4. Continue Practice

- Commit to regular attendance if it resonates
- You're a peer from day one - no hierarchy
- Consider helping with simple tasks (setup, timing, etc.)

## Starting a New Node

### Prerequisites

You **don't need to be**:
- An experienced meditator
- A teacher or guru
- Affiliated with any organization
- Specially trained

You **do need to**:
- Commit to the [Heart Protocol](heart-protocol.md)
- Maintain peer structure (no hierarchy)
- Keep it free (no fees ever)
- Have space for 2+ people to sit

### Steps to Start

#### 1. Prepare Your Space

**Physical node:**
- Quiet space (home, park, community room)
- Seating for 3-8 people
- Timer/phone for bells

**Virtual node:**
- Video conferencing (Jitsi, Zoom, etc.)
- Reliable internet connection
- Quiet private space

#### 2. Set Your Schedule

- Choose 1-2 regular weekly times
- Pick times you can commit to for 3+ months
- Consider timezone for virtual nodes
- Standard sessions: 60 or 90 minutes

#### 3. Register Your Node

**Create your node file:**

```bash
# Copy the template
cp nodes/template/node-template.yaml nodes/[country]/[city]/[your-node-id].yaml

# Edit with your details
# Use a text editor to fill in all fields
```

**Submit via GitHub:**

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your node YAML file in the correct location
3. Commit the file
4. Submit a pull request
5. Wait for review (usually 24-48 hours)

**Don't use GitHub?**
- Email your node details to: registry@meditation.network
- We'll create the YAML file and submit on your behalf

#### 4. Spread the Word Locally

- Post in local meditation groups
- Share on community boards
- Tell friends interested in meditation
- Keep it simple and non-promotional

#### 5. Run Your First Session

**Before the session:**
- Set up space
- Test timer
- Have water available
- Create welcoming atmosphere

**During the session:**
- Start on time
- Follow [Heart Protocol](heart-protocol.md)
- Keep it simple
- No teaching or lecturing

**After the session:**
- Optional brief sharing
- Thank people for coming
- Confirm next session time

### First Session Tips

**It's normal to:**
- Feel a bit awkward facilitating
- Have only 1-2 people show up
- Wonder if you're doing it "right"
- Feel like you're not qualified

**Remember:**
- You're a peer, not a teacher
- Small groups are perfect
- The protocol is the structure
- No one is "qualified" - that's the point

**Common mistakes:**
- Over-explaining or teaching
- Making it too complex
- Trying to be spiritual
- Not following the timing

**Keep it simple:** Ring bell. Sit together. Ring bell. Done.

## Growing Your Node

### Organic Growth

- Consistency matters most
- Word of mouth is best
- Quality over quantity
- 3-6 regulars is ideal

### Maintaining Peer Structure

As your node grows:
- Rotate facilitation roles
- Share responsibilities equally
- Gently redirect anyone trying to teach
- Remember: everyone is a beginner at being a peer

### When to Split

Consider starting a second node when:
- Space becomes too crowded (8+ people)
- Different timezone needs emerge
- Someone wants to practice in another area

This is healthy network growth.

## Node Types

### Physical Nodes

**Pros:**
- Stronger sense of community
- Energetic benefit of practicing together
- Natural after-session connection

**Cons:**
- Location-dependent
- Weather/logistics challenges
- Harder to maintain consistency

### Virtual Nodes

**Pros:**
- Weather-proof
- Accessible to remote areas
- Easy to coordinate
- Record sessions for those who miss

**Cons:**
- Less energetic coherence
- Technical issues possible
- Screen fatigue

See [Virtual Nodes Guide](virtual-nodes.md) for detailed virtual setup.

### Hybrid Nodes

**Best of both:**
- Core group meets physically
- Virtual option for remote participants
- Requires more setup but maximum accessibility

## Troubleshooting

### "Nobody's coming to my sessions"

- Give it 3 months minimum
- Stay consistent with schedule
- Share in one new place each week
- Consider timezone for virtual nodes
- Small is fine - even one other person

### "Someone wants to teach/lead"

- Gently point to Heart Protocol
- Emphasize peer structure
- Suggest they start their own teaching group elsewhere
- This is a practice network, not a teaching platform

### "People want to discuss/add other practices"

- DMN is specifically for Heart Protocol
- Other practices are great - elsewhere
- Keep the network focused
- Suggest starting a different group for other interests

### "I can't maintain the schedule"

- Update your node YAML file
- Mark status as "paused" temporarily
- Or mark "archived" if stopping
- It's okay - life happens
