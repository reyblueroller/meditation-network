Complete Phase 2 Prompt for Claude Code
Copy everything below and paste into Claude Code:

Generate Phase 2 content for DMN (Distributed Meditation Network).

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Heart-centered peer meditation network (open-source infrastructure)
- TWO complementary perspectives: secular/evidence-based AND spiritual/consciousness
- Scripts must be framework-neutral (work for both audiences)
- First session: January 24, 2026
- This is an infrastructure MOVEMENT (not a product, not a business)

CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

1. FRAMEWORK-NEUTRAL LANGUAGE
   - No spiritual jargon (chakras, energy, divine)
   - No clinical jargon (cortisol, parasympathetic, neural pathways)
   - Phenomenological descriptions (what is felt/experienced)
   - Body-based, concrete language
   - Works for secular AND spiritual practitioners

2. BEGINNER-FRIENDLY BUT NOT HAND-HOLDING
   - Front-load essentials (posture, what we're doing)
   - Strategic checkpoints (every 3-5 min)
   - Trust longer pauses (60-90s in practice sections)
   - RATIO: 20-30% guidance, 70-80% practice/silence

3. DIRECT, NOT PERMISSION-SEEKING
   - Use: "Bring attention to..." "Notice..." "Place..."
   - Avoid: "If you'd like..." "Maybe you could..." "If comfortable..."
   - Confident tone without being authoritarian
   - Options only for genuine alternatives (posture, breath location)

4. AFFIRMATION + INTENTION MIXED STYLE
   - Mix declarative affirmations ("I am grateful")
   - With intention phrases ("May I be kind")
   - Let practitioners use what resonates
   - Both styles in each script

5. NO BRAND PROMOTION
   - Generic techniques only (no HeartMath, no specific programs)
   - Research cited by academic papers (not brands)
   - Measurement options generic (not product recommendations)

CREATE 17 NEW FILES + UPDATE 3 EXISTING FILES:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PART 1: MEDITATION SCRIPTS (5 files)

CRITICAL SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:

- Press play and go (no training needed)
- Middle ground detail (not hand-holding, not too sparse)
- Heart-centered breathing integrated (generic technique)
- Pause structure: 5-10s transitions, 20-30s after phrases, 60-90s practice
- Direct instruction (no permission-seeking)
- Framework-neutral throughout

Rest in whatever you're experiencing...

[PAUSE: 45s]

We'll continue in silence for thirty minutes...

Stay with this heart space... this intention of self-compassion...

[PAUSE: 10s]

# Silent Integration (30 minutes)

## Purpose
- Allow heart-opening to stabilize
- Collective field development
- Integration of cultivated qualities

## Bell Structure
- 00:00 Opening bell (transition from guided practice)
- 10:00 Soft bell (gentle reminder)
- 20:00 Soft bell (gentle reminder)
- 30:00 Closing bell (end of silence)

## Facilitator Instructions

The silent period is the core of the practice—not empty time.

**What practitioners do:**
- Rest in heart awareness
- Notice whatever arises without grasping
- Allow cultivation to settle naturally
- Feel collective presence of group

**What facilitators do:**
- Maintain meditation posture (model commitment)
- Stay present (no phone, no leaving room)
- Ring bells precisely at 10, 20, 30 minutes
- Hold space energetically through your own practice

**Bell guidelines:**
- Use singing bowl, chime, or soft bell
- Not jarring—gentle reminder of presence
- Single strike, let it fade naturally
- Volume: Clear but not startling

**For virtual nodes:**
- Gallery view with cameras optional
- Bell confirms connection every 10 min
- Timer visible (optional) for participants
- Facilitator stays on camera (models presence)

**After 30 minutes:**
- Closing bell signals end
- Brief pause before opening eyes
- Transition to sharing circle (10 min)

## Integration Notes

**What's happening during silence:**
- Phrases dissolve, qualities remain
- Individual practice becomes collective field
- Heart opening settles into being
- No effort, just presence

**This is where collective coherence emerges.**

Silent practice together is different from silent practice alone—
the field is palpable, supportive, amplifying.

**Trust the silence. It's doing the work.**

**Research-backed frequencies:**
- Binaural beats (brainwave entrainment)
- Solfeggio frequencies (528 Hz for heart)
- Coherent breathing rhythms
- Schumann resonance (7.83 Hz)

**Volume: -35 to -40dB (very subtle, barely audible)**

## Frequency Recommendations

**Grounding (5 min):**
- 7.83 Hz binaural (Schumann resonance - earth frequency)
- Carrier: 200 Hz left, 207.83 Hz right
- Grounding, centering effect

**Heart Activation (15 min):**
- 528 Hz solfeggio (heart-centered frequency)
- Pure tone or binaural
- Associated with love, transformation

**Silent Integration (30 min):**
- 5 Hz theta binaural (deep meditation)
- Carrier: 200 Hz left, 205 Hz right
- Collective coherence support

## How to Generate

**Method 1: Audacity (Free)**
[Step-by-step instructions for generating binaural beats and pure tones]

**Method 2: Python Script**
[Provide simple script using numpy/scipy for generating frequency files]

**Method 3: Online Generators**
- Generic options (no brands)
- Free tools available

## Mixing with Session Audio

[Instructions for layering frequencies under voice + music in Audacity]
[Volume levels, fade in/out, stereo requirements for binaural]

## Research Background (Brand-Neutral)

**Heart-brain coherence research:**
- Heart-centered focus with specific breathing creates measurable coherence

- Google Cloud TTS (300 chars/month free)
- Microsoft Azure TTS (5M chars free first month)

**Process:**
1. Copy script
2. Remove [PAUSE: Xs] markers (add manually in editing)
3. Generate audio
4. Import to Audacity
5. Add pauses as silence

## Option 2: Record Yourself

**Equipment:**
- USB microphone ($30-100) OR good phone mic
- Quiet room (minimal echo)
- Audacity (free)

**Settings:**
- Sample rate: 44100 Hz

**Tips:**
- Slower than normal speech
- Warm, calm tone
- Record in sections
- Leave space for mistakes

## Mixing Audio (Audacity)

**Track structure:**
1. Bell (opening) - 0dB
2. Music (background) - -22 to -24dB
3. Frequency (optional) - -35 to -40dB
4. Voice (guided script) - 0dB (normalized)
5. Bells (transitions) - -6dB

**Workflow:**
1. Import all components
2. Align timing
3. Adjust volumes
4. Add fades (music start/end)
5. Export as MP3 (192 kbps)

## Session Assembly

**For 60-minute session:**

**Option A: Modular files (recommended)**
- 00-grounding-5min.mp3
- 01-self-compassion-15min.mp3 (or 02, 03)
- 99-silent-30min.mp3
- Play sequentially

**Option B: Single file**
- Mix all into one 60-min file
- Less flexible but simpler playback

## Heart-Centered Breathing Technique

**Generic technique (no brand promotion):**

**What it is:**
- Focus attention at heart center (chest)
- Imagine breath flowing through heart
- Natural slowing to ~5-6 breaths/minute
- Combined with positive emotions

**Why it works (research-backed):**
- Heart rhythm affects brain function
- Focused heart attention creates physiological coherence
- Positive emotions enhance effect
- Group practice amplifies individual coherence

**In scripts:**
- "Breathing through your heart"
- "In through heart center, out through heart center"
- Natural pacing (no forced counts)

## Quality Checklist

## What We're Building

DMN provides open-source infrastructure for peer meditation groups.

**Not a meditation app. Not a spiritual organization. Not a business.**

**Infrastructure** - protocols, tools, systems that help people practice together sustainably.

## The Gap We're Filling

### Solo Practice Is Hard to Sustain
- 90% of people who start meditating quit within 6 months
- Willpower alone insufficient
- No accountability
- Feels isolating

### Drop-In Classes Don't Create Depth
- No commitment required = shallow engagement
- Different people every week = no group coherence
- Transactional relationship
- Can't build on previous sessions

### Teacher-Led Practice Has Limitations
- **Teachers provide value:** Technique instruction, correction, wisdom transmission
- **But:** Can create dependency if not balanced with peer practice
- **Groups need:** Both teaching (for technique) AND peer practice (for sustainability)
- **DMN fills the peer infrastructure gap** that complements teacher-led learning

**Teachers are welcome to:**
- Train node facilitators (outside sessions)
- Offer periodic intensives (separate from weekly practice)
- Provide troubleshooting support (remote)
- Participate as peers (during sessions - not as teachers)

**During DMN sessions:**
- Protocol is the teacher, not any person
- All participants are peers (including experienced practitioners)
- Teachers participate through practice, not instruction

### Existing Infrastructure Assumes Hierarchy
- All meditation infrastructure assumes teacher-student model
- No protocols for peer-facilitated groups
- No tools for distributed networks
- Organizations centralize control

**We're building the missing piece: peer-to-peer meditation infrastructure.**

## Our Solution

### 1. Peer Structure
**Everyone equal:**
- No teachers or gurus during sessions
- Facilitation rotates among members
- No authority positions
- Decisions made collectively

**Experienced practitioners:**
- Participate as peers (not teachers)
- Act as field anchors/amplifiers through practice
- Support through presence, not instruction

**Why this works:**
- Prevents dependency
- Distributes responsibility
- Builds autonomy
- Resilient (doesn't collapse if one person leaves)

### 2. Weekly Commitment
**Regular practice, long-term:**
- Same time, same place, every week
- Commitment to the group (not just yourself)
- Build on previous sessions
- Depth emerges over months/years

### 3. Heart-Centered Practice
**Compassion meditation (research-validated):**
- Self-compassion
- Loved ones
- Gratitude
- Silent integration

**Based on research:**
- Heart-brain coherence effects
- Heart rate variability synchronization
- Positive emotions enhance coherence
- Group practice amplifies individual effects

**Technique:**
- Heart-centered breathing (generic, research-backed)
- Mixed affirmation/intention phrases
- Framework-neutral (accessible to all)

### 4. Open Source
**Everything public and forkable:**
- Protocols documented on GitHub
- Tools are open-source code
- Anyone can adapt/modify
- No proprietary methods

### 5. Distributed Network
**Autonomous nodes, not centralized organization:**
- Each node operates independently
- Nodes connect horizontally (peer-to-peer)
- No central authority
- Network resilient to single points of failure

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based
**We measure what works:**
- Track participation and retention
- Collect practitioner feedback
- Partner with researchers
- Publish findings openly
- Adapt based on data

### 2. Accessibility First
**Free and open to all:**
- No fees for protocols or tools
- No prerequisites or requirements
- No spiritual beliefs needed
- Works across cultures and backgrounds

### 3. Integrity Over Growth
**We prioritize:**
- Maintaining peer structure (even if limits growth)
- Protocol quality (over rapid expansion)
- Existing node stability (over launching new ones)
- Long-term sustainability (over short-term metrics)

### 4. Transparency
**Everything visible:**
- All code on GitHub (public)
- All protocols documented (open)
- All data shared (when possible)
- All decisions explained

## What Success Looks Like

### Individual Level
- Sustained practice (2+ years, not 2 months)
- Improved emotional regulation (self-reported + validated)
- Increased compassion (behavioral measures)
- Better stress management
- Enhanced well-being

### Group Level
- Node survives founder leaving
- Rotating facilitation works
- Peer structure maintained
- No guru dynamics emerge
- Collective field develops

### Network Level
- Self-organizing without central control
- Protocols improve through community feedback

## Research Foundations

**DMN practice builds on established research:**

### Heart-Brain Coherence Research
- Heart-centered focus creates measurable physiological coherence
- Heart rate variability (HRV) synchronizes with breathing patterns
- Coherent state associated with ~5-6 breaths per minute
- Positive emotions (gratitude, compassion) enhance coherence
- Group meditation shows synchronized HRV patterns

**Key findings:**
- Heart generates body's strongest electromagnetic field
- Heart rhythm patterns affect cognitive and emotional function
- Coherent heart rhythms correlate with improved well-being
- Collective coherence measurable in group settings

### Compassion Meditation Research
- Increases empathy and prosocial behavior (neuroscience)
- Reduces stress and improves well-being (clinical studies)
- Develops emotional regulation (psychology)
- Reduces implicit bias (social psychology)

### Collective Coherence (Emerging)
- Group meditation synchronizes brain activity (EEG)
- Heart rate variability coherence across participants
- Field effects in meditation groups
- Further research needed (DMN contribution)

## Comparison: DMN vs. Alternatives

| Aspect | DMN | Apps | Teacher Groups | Drop-in Classes |
|--------|-----|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Structure | Peer-to-peer | Individual | Teacher-led | Instructor-led |
| Cost | Free | $10-20/mo | Varies | $15-30/session |
| Commitment | Weekly | None | Varies | None |
| Community | Stable group | None | Sangha | Rotating |
| Teaching | Protocol-guided | Recorded | Live instruction | Class format |
| Best For | Sustained practice | Flexibility | Learning technique | Sampling styles |

**Each serves different needs. DMN fills the peer infrastructure gap.**

**Optimal: Learn from teachers, practice with peers.**

## Who This Is For

### ✅ DMN Works Well If You:
- Want regular meditation with accountability
- Prefer peer relationships over teacher-student
- Can commit to weekly practice long-term
- Are comfortable with minimal instruction
- Value community and collective practice
- Willing to take responsibility for own practice

### ❌ DMN Probably Isn't Right If You:
- Want extensive teacher guidance
- Prefer drop-in flexibility
- Need therapeutic processing
- Want quick results or peak experiences
- Require spiritual teachings or path
- Prefer centralized organization with clear leadership

**Both approaches valid. Choose what fits.**

## For Teachers and Experienced Practitioners

**How you can support DMN:**

**Outside sessions (appropriate):**
- Train node facilitators in technique basics
- Answer protocol questions
- Offer troubleshooting (remotely)
- Lead separate intensives for practitioners
- Research collaboration

**During sessions (inappropriate):**
- Teaching or instructing
- Correcting others
- Taking authority position
- Modifying protocol

**If you participate in a node:**
- Practice as peer (not teacher)
- Follow protocol exactly
- Rotate facilitation like everyone
- Serve as anchor/amplifier through presence
- Your restraint is your contribution

**The protocol is the teacher. You are a practitioner.**

## Our Commitment

**We commit to:**
- Maintaining peer structure (always)
- Keeping everything open-source (free forever)
- Following evidence (not dogma)
- Supporting node autonomy (distributed control)
- Building for long-term (generational thinking)

**We will never:**
- Create hierarchy or authority positions
- Charge for access or protocols
- Centralize control
- Require beliefs
- Prioritize growth over integrity
