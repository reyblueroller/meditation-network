# 📋 Facilitator's Checklist: Running a Node Pulse

To ensure frequency consistency across the global network, every node operator should follow this 5-step process.

---

### 1. Prepare the Space
* **Location:** Find a quiet, stable location (physical or virtual).
* **Audio Setup:** Test your Bluetooth speaker or audio output.
* **Offline Mode:** Ensure you have the latest **Heart Protocol v1.0** audio file downloaded to your device so the pulse isn't interrupted by buffering or connection drops.

### 2. Initialize the Node
* **The Arrival:** 5 minutes before the pulse begins, welcome arriving peers.
* **The Framing:** Remind the group: *"We are a peer-led node. There are no gurus here. We are simply holding space for collective stability."*
* **Silence Devices:** Ask everyone to set their phones to 'Do Not Disturb' or airplane mode.

### 3. Activate the Protocol
* **Start the Audio:** Play the 30-minute **Relatable Voice** track.
* **Presence:** As the facilitator, participate fully. Your nervous system is a primary component of the local field.
* **Contingency:** If technical issues occur, simply maintain the silence. The field is held by the shared intent, not just the sound.

### 4. Grounding & Closing
* **Integration:** Once the audio finishes, allow for 1–2 minutes of natural, unguided transition.
* **Gratitude:** Briefly thank the peers for their contribution to the global network.
* **Continuity:** Mention the next scheduled pulse time for your node.

### 5. Submit Field Report
* **Log Data:** Open the [🌱 Field Reports](https://github.com/reyblueroller/meditation-network/discussions/categories/field-reports) category on GitHub.
* **Report:** Submit your data (Participant count, Field Quality, and Observations).
* **Impact:** This step is vital—it turns your local session into visible data for the 2027 Roadmap.

> [!TIP]
> **Consistency is Key.** It is better to have a small, stable 2-person node that meets every week than a large 20-person node that meets sporadically.
