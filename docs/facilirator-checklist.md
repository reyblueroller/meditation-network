# 📋 Micro-Node Facilitator Checklist
*Guidance for Home Nodes and Community Shared Spaces*

This checklist is designed for "Micro-Nodes"—small groups meeting in living rooms, backyards, or rented community halls. The goal is to keep the overhead low and the connection high.

### 1. Preparing the Space
* **Home Nodes:** Clear a central circle in your living room. Move furniture to the edges so everyone can sit at the same level.
* **Community Halls:** If renting, arrive 15 minutes early to set the "Field." Low lighting or a simple centerpiece helps ground the room.
* **Neutrality:** Ensure the space is free from distractions (turn off TVs, silence kitchen appliances, and alert housemates of the 30-minute quiet window).

### 2. The "Shared Stewardship" Model (Costs)
If you are renting a hall or providing tea/supplies, use the peer-sharing model:
* **Transparency:** Total Rent ÷ Number of Participants = Suggested Contribution.
* **The Jar:** Place a small container by the entrance. 
* **Non-Profit:** Remind peers that this is a "cost-recovery" model, not a commercial service. We share the space, we share the cost.

### 3. Technical Calibration
* **Central Audio:** Place a single 360° Bluetooth speaker in the **exact center** of the circle on the floor. 

* **Offline First:** Always play the **Heart Protocol v1.0** from a downloaded file.
* **The "Silent Pulse" Fix:** Ensure your device volume is at 100% and use the *speaker's* physical buttons to adjust the room volume. This prevents many speakers from entering "Auto-Sleep" during the 10-minute silence.

### 4. Running the Session
* **The Framing:** Open with: *"We are a peer-led node. We are here to stabilize our local field. There are no gurus here; we are simply holding space together."*
* **Device Silence:** Ask everyone to set phones to **Airplane Mode**. In a small room, one notification vibration can be felt by the whole group.
* **The Transition:** Once the 30-minute track ends, allow 2 minutes of "Social Silence." Let people emerge at their own pace.

### 5. Grounding & Reporting
* **Clean Up:** If in a shared hall, ensure the space is returned to its original state as a gesture of respect for the community.
* **Field Report:** Post a brief update to your **Node Issue** on GitHub:
    * *Participants:* (e.g., 4 peers)
    * *Environment:* (e.g., Home Node, quiet)
    * *Field Quality:* (e.g., Stable/Coherent)

> [!TIP]
> **Start Small.** A consistent node of 3 neighbors is more powerful for the 2027 Roadmap than a large group that only meets once.
