# 🔊 Audio & Hardware Guide

To maintain a stable frequency field, the audio quality and hardware reliability of each node are essential. Use this guide to optimize your setup.

### 1. Recommended Hardware
While any speaker works, we recommend **360-degree omnidirectional speakers** (e.g., UE Boom, Bose SoundLink, or JBL Flip). 
* **Placement:** Place the speaker in the center of the room on the floor or a low table.
* **Height:** Keeping the speaker at "heart level" for seated participants helps with the resonance visualization.

### 2. Preventing "Auto-Sleep" (Critical)
Many speakers automatically turn off after 5–10 minutes of silence to save battery. This will break the "Silent Pulse" phase of the protocol.
* **The Fix:** Ensure your playback device (phone/laptop) is set to 100% volume, and control the actual room volume using the **speaker's physical buttons**. 
* **Pro Tip:** Some facilitators play a very low-frequency "brown noise" or "sub-bass hum" (below 40Hz) during the silence to keep the Bluetooth connection active without being audible to the ears.

### 3. Connection Stability
* **Download, Don't Stream:** Always download the `.wav` or `.mp3` file to your device. Relying on Wi-Fi or Cellular data during a global pulse introduces the risk of buffering.
* **Airplane Mode:** Put your playback device into Airplane Mode but keep Bluetooth on. This prevents notification pings or incoming calls from interrupting the field.

### 4. Group Volume Levels
* **The "Whisper" Rule:** The AI voice should be loud enough to be clear, but soft enough that it feels like a thought in the room rather than a lecture. 
* **The Silence:** The transition into the 10-minute silence should feel seamless. If your speaker "hisses" when quiet, consider a wired (Aux) connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Node Calibration**
> Before your first public session, run a "Dry Pulse." Play the full 30-minute track in your empty space to ensure your hardware stays powered on until the very last second.
