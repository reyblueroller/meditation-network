# Practice Scripts

Optional minimal verbal guidance for Heart Protocol sessions.

## Purpose

This directory contains simple, non-dogmatic scripts for:
- Phase transitions during sessions
- Minimal verbal guidance for beginners
- Virtual session coordination

## Important

These scripts are:
- **Optional** - Silence is preferred
- **Minimal** - Just enough to guide, not teach
- **Rotating** - Any peer can read them
- **Non-authoritative** - Instructions, not teachings

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

- First few sessions with complete beginners
- Virtual sessions where verbal cues help coordination
- When requested by group

### When NOT to Use

- Every session (creates dependency)
- As platform for teaching
- To establish authority
- When silence works fine

### How to Use

1. Rotate who reads (don't create a "leader")
2. Read simply, without adding interpretation
3. Keep voice neutral, not "spiritual"
4. Gradually reduce usage as group develops

## Script Format

Scripts should:
- Mark each phase clearly
- Give simple, concrete instructions
- Avoid metaphysical language
- Be completable in under 30 seconds per phase
- Focus on "what to do" not "what it means"

## Contributing Scripts

Guidelines for contributions:

**Good:**
- "Bring attention to the physical heart area"
- "Notice sensations in the chest"
- "Generate a feeling of warmth"
- "Extend this feeling outward"

**Avoid:**
- Spiritual terminology
- Metaphysical explanations
- Long flowery descriptions
- Anything that sounds like teaching

## Philosophy

The Heart Protocol is simple enough to practice without verbal guidance. These scripts exist only to help transition beginners into the practice.

The goal is to become unnecessary.
