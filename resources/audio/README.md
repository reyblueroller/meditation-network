# Audio Resources

Optional audio resources for meditation sessions.

## Purpose

This directory can contain:
- Bell sounds for session timing
- Optional guided audio for Heart Protocol phases
- Background ambient sounds (if desired)

## Guidelines

### What Belongs Here

**Appropriate:**
- Simple bell/chime sounds
- Basic verbal phase guidance (minimal, optional)
- Ambient nature sounds (optional)

**Not appropriate:**
- Spiritual teachings or lectures
- Music with lyrics
- Guided visualizations beyond Heart Protocol
- Anything that creates dependency on audio

### File Formats

- **Preferred**: MP3, OGG (web-compatible)
- **Also acceptable**: WAV, FLAC
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 5MB when possible)

### Licensing

Only contribute audio that is:
- Your own creation
- Public domain
- CC0 or compatible Creative Commons license
- Explicitly permitted for redistribution

Include license information with each file.

## Usage

Audio resources are **completely optional**. The Heart Protocol works perfectly well in silence with just a simple timer.

## Contributing

To add audio resources:

1. Ensure file meets licensing requirements
2. Add file to appropriate subdirectory
3. Include `LICENSE.txt` or attribution
4. Update this README with description
5. Submit pull request

## Current Resources

*None yet - this is a placeholder for community contributions*

### How to Use

- Download desired audio files
- Use with session timer
- Share screen with audio during virtual sessions
- Or practice in complete silence

## Philosophy

Audio is a tool, not a requirement. The practice is accessible without any resources beyond a timer. These are conveniences, not dependencies.

**Silence is always an option.**
