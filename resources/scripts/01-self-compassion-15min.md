## Script

[Continuing from grounding practice...]

Rest your awareness in the center of your chest... the heart space...

[PAUSE: 8s]

You might notice sensations here... warmth... openness... or perhaps tension... tightness...

Whatever is present... simply allow it to be...

[PAUSE: 10s]

This is the space from which we'll cultivate compassion...

Not forcing anything... just gently inviting...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Begin by bringing to mind a simple wish for your own wellbeing...

[PAUSE: 5s]

You can use traditional phrases... or find words that resonate with you...

[PAUSE: 5s]

Silently, gently, with each phrase... feel into your heart...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

Let these phrases be gentle... like a lullaby... not a demand...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

If resistance arises... if it feels difficult to offer yourself kindness... that's okay...

Notice the resistance with compassion too...

[PAUSE: 10s]

You can place your hand on your heart... a gesture of care...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Continuing with the phrases... at your own rhythm...

[PAUSE: 5s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Notice any warmth... any softening in the heart space...

Even the smallest shift... acknowledge it...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 20s]

You're cultivating a quality that's always available...

The capacity to hold yourself with kindness...

[PAUSE: 10s]

A few more rounds... feeling the phrases in your heart...

[PAUSE: 5s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 20s]

Now let the words fade...

Simply rest in whatever warmth has been generated...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Your heart... breathing... open...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Allow this quality of self-compassion to settle...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Breathing naturally... resting in the heart space...

[PAUSE: 20s]
