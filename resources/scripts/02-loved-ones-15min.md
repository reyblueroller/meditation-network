## Script

[Continuing from self-compassion practice...]

Notice the warmth you've cultivated in your heart space...

[PAUSE: 8s]

This quality of kindness... this capacity for compassion...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Now we'll extend it outward... like light radiating from the heart...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Bring to mind someone you care about...

Someone for whom it's easy to feel warmth...

[PAUSE: 10s]

This could be a close friend... a family member... a mentor... even a beloved pet...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Choose someone alive... someone whose wellbeing matters to you...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Picture them gently... or simply feel their presence...

No need for a perfect image... just a sense of this being...

[PAUSE: 12s]

Notice how your heart responds to thinking of them...

Perhaps there's a natural warmth... a smile... an opening...

[PAUSE: 10s]

From your heart to theirs... offer these wishes...

[PAUSE: 5s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

Feel the sincerity of these wishes...

You genuinely want this person to be well...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

This is not about making anything happen...

Simply offering goodwill... heart to heart...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Notice the quality of your heart as you offer these wishes...

Perhaps there's joy... gratitude... connection...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 20s]

Continuing silently... at your own pace...

Feeling the warmth moving from your heart to theirs...

[PAUSE: 30s]

Now if you wish... you can expand this field of care...

Include other loved ones... friends... family... pets...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Picture them gathered... or simply feel their presence...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Offering the same wishes to all of them...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May you be safe...

May you be healthy...

May you be at ease...

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

All the beings you care about... held in this field of warmth...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Allow the phrases to fade...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Rest in the feeling of connection... of love... of care...

[PAUSE: 15s]

This warmth in your heart... radiating outward...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Breathing naturally... feeling the collective field...

[PAUSE: 20s]
