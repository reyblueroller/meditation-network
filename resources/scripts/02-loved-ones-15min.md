## Script

[Continuing from self-compassion practice...]

Notice whatever sensations are present in your chest area...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Whatever intention you've been working with... whatever has developed...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Now directing that same intention toward someone else...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Bringing to mind someone you care about...

Someone toward whom goodwill comes easily...

[PAUSE: 10s]

A friend... family member... mentor... pet... someone currently living...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Someone whose wellbeing matters to you...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Bringing them to mind however works for you... an image... their voice... just a sense of them...

[PAUSE: 12s]

Noticing what happens in your chest when you think of them...

Maybe warmth... maybe a smile... maybe expansion... or maybe just recognition...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Directing these intentions toward them...

[PAUSE: 5s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

Noticing the sincerity of this intention... wanting them to be well...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

This is not about making anything happen...

Simply offering goodwill... heart to heart...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Notice the quality of your heart as you offer these wishes...

Perhaps there's joy... gratitude... connection...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 20s]

Continuing silently... at your own pace...

Feeling the warmth moving from your heart to theirs...

[PAUSE: 30s]

Now if you wish... you can expand this field of care...

Include other loved ones... friends... family... pets...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Picture them gathered... or simply feel their presence...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Offering the same wishes to all of them...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May you be safe...

May you be healthy...

May you be at ease...

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

All the beings you care about... held in this field of warmth...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Allow the phrases to fade...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Rest in the feeling of connection... of love... of care...

[PAUSE: 15s]

This warmth in your heart... radiating outward...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Breathing naturally... feeling the collective field...

[PAUSE: 20s]
