## Script

[BELL - soft opening]

[PAUSE: 3s]

Finding a position that feels stable for you...

Notice where your body makes contact with what's beneath you... the pressure... the temperature...

[PAUSE: 10s]

If it feels right, allow your eyes to close... or lower your gaze...

[PAUSE: 5s]

Bring attention to the physical sensations in your body...

Notice what's present in your feet... legs... hips... whatever you can feel...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Sensations in your belly... chest... shoulders...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Your arms... hands... face... jaw...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Simply noticing what's here... tightness... warmth... tingling... numbness... or nothing in particular...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Now bringing attention to breathing...

Not controlling it... just noticing it as it is...

[PAUSE: 8s]

You might feel breath sensations in your belly... your chest... your throat... or nostrils...

Wherever you feel it most clearly... rest your attention there...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Each breath happening on its own... no need to manage it...

[PAUSE: 15s]

When attention moves away... which it will... just noticing where it went... then returning to breath sensations...

This returning is the practice... not a problem to fix...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Continuing with the rhythm that's already happening...

[PAUSE: 20s]

Now shifting attention to the center of your chest... the area around your heart...

[PAUSE: 5s]

Just noticing what sensations are present... warmth... pressure... openness... tightness... or perhaps nothing noticeable yet...

[PAUSE: 5s]

[Transition to heart activation practice]
