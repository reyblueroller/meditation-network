## Script

[BELL - soft opening]

[PAUSE: 3s]

Welcome. Take a moment to settle into your seat...

Feel the weight of your body... the contact with the chair or cushion beneath you...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Let your eyes gently close, or soften your gaze downward...

[PAUSE: 5s]

Begin by bringing awareness to your body...

Notice the sensations in your feet... your legs... your hips...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Feel your belly... your chest... your shoulders...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Notice your arms... your hands... your face...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Just awareness... no need to change anything... simply noticing what's here...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Now bring your attention to your breath...

Not controlling it... just feeling it...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Notice where you feel the breath most clearly...

Perhaps in your belly... rising and falling...

Or in your chest... expanding and releasing...

Or at your nostrils... the subtle sensation of air moving...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Breathing naturally... at your own pace...

[PAUSE: 15s]

If your mind wanders, that's completely normal...

Simply notice where it went... and gently return attention to the breath...

[PAUSE: 15s]

A few more moments with the natural rhythm of breathing...

[PAUSE: 20s]

Now we'll transition into heart-centered practice...

Bring your attention to the center of your chest... the heart space...

[PAUSE: 5s]

Just noticing what's present there... no judgment... no expectation...

[PAUSE: 5s]

[Transition to heart activation practice]
