## DIY: Create Your Own Ambient

### Using Audacity (Free)

**Simple drone:**
1. Generate → Tone → Sine wave
2. Frequency: 432 Hz (heart chakra) or 528 Hz (love frequency)
3. Amplitude: 0.3
4. Duration: 30 minutes
5. Effect → Fade In (5 sec)
6. Effect → Fade Out (5 sec)
7. Export as MP3

**Layered ambient:**
1. Generate 3 sine waves:
   - 432 Hz (fundamental)
   - 540 Hz (harmonic)
   - 648 Hz (overtone)
2. Amplitude: 0.2 each
3. Layer in separate tracks
4. Add subtle fade in/out
5. Mix down, export

### Using Online Tools

**MyNoise.net**
- Free ambient sound generator
- "Anamnesis" preset (meditation)
- "Gregorian Voices" (sacred ambience)
- Can export custom mixes

## Music vs. Silence

**When to use music:**
- Grounding practice (helps settle)
- Heart activation (supports opening)
- Background for voice (quiet under -20dB)
- First few sessions (eases discomfort)

**When to use silence:**
- Silent integration period (preferred)
- Once group is comfortable
- To deepen practice
- Following DMN philosophy (minimal)

**Default recommendation:**
- Music for grounding (5 min)
- Music for heart activation (15 min)
- Silence for integration (30 min)

## Volume Guidelines

**Critical:** Music should never compete with voice or meditation.

- **Under voice:** -20dB to -22dB (barely noticeable)
- **Silent integration:** -24dB to -26dB (subtle presence) OR complete silence
- **Between practices:** -12dB (audible but calm)

**Test it:** You should be able to hear voice clearly without strain. Music is a subtle support, not a feature.

## Quick Start for Jan 24

**Easiest path:**
1. Go to incompetech.com
2. Download "Meditation Impromptu 01" and "02"
3. Use Audacity to create 5min and 15min loops
4. Mix at -20dB under your voice recording
5. For 30min silence: bells only OR loop "Meditation Impromptu 03"

**Alternative (even simpler):**
- Use complete silence
- Only bells at 10-min intervals
- Many practitioners prefer this
- No attribution needed
- Deepest practice

**Remember:** Music is optional. Silence is powerful. Start simple.
