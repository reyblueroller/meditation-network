# Music Resources

Optional background music for meditation sessions.

## Caution

Background music during Heart Protocol sessions is **not recommended** for most groups.

### Why Not?

- Can distract from practice
- Creates dependency
- Not necessary for the protocol
- Silence is more universally accessible
- Adds complexity without clear benefit

### When It Might Work

Some groups may find gentle background music helpful if:
- All participants prefer it
- It's instrumental only (no lyrics)
- It's very subtle
- The group has tried silence first

## If You Choose to Use Music

### Guidelines

**Appropriate:**
- Instrumental ambient
- Very minimal composition
- No sudden changes
- Low volume (barely noticeable)

**Not appropriate:**
- Music with lyrics
- Anything with cultural/religious associations
- Complex compositions
- Anything that draws attention to itself

### Licensing

Only contribute music that is:
- Your own creation
- Public domain
- CC0 or compatible Creative Commons license
- Explicitly permitted for redistribution

## Current Resources

*None - and that's probably fine*

## Philosophy

The Heart Protocol doesn't require music. If you think you need background music, try a few more sessions in silence first.

Silence is not empty. It's full of practice.

## Alternative

If your group wants sonic support:
- Use the session timer bell sounds
- Try a subtle room tone generator
- Practice near gentle ambient sounds (fountain, light rain outside)
- Keep it natural and minimal

**When in doubt, choose silence.**
