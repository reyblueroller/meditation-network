# Audio Resources

Optional audio resources for meditation sessions.

## Purpose

This directory can contain:
- Bell sounds for session timing
- Optional guided audio for Heart Protocol phases
- Background ambient sounds (if desired)

## Guidelines

### What Belongs Here

**Appropriate:**
- Simple bell/chime sounds
- Basic verbal phase guidance (minimal, optional)
- Ambient nature sounds (optional)

**Not appropriate:**
- Spiritual teachings or lectures
- Music with lyrics
- Guided visualizations beyond Heart Protocol
- Anything that creates dependency on audio

### File Formats

- **Preferred**: MP3, OGG (web-compatible)
- **Also acceptable**: WAV, FLAC
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 5MB when possible)

### Licensing

Only contribute audio that is:
- Your own creation
- Public domain
- CC0 or compatible Creative Commons license
- Explicitly permitted for redistribution

Include license information with each file.

## Usage

Audio resources are **completely optional**. The Heart Protocol works perfectly well in silence with just a simple timer.

## Contributing

To add audio resources:

1. Ensure file meets licensing requirements
2. Add file to appropriate subdirectory
3. Include `LICENSE.txt` or attribution
4. Update this README with description

### How to Use

**Option 1: Create your own audio**
1. Follow the [PRODUCTION-GUIDE.md](PRODUCTION-GUIDE.md)
2. Use scripts from [../scripts/](../scripts/)
3. Mix with Audacity or Python script
4. Export session MP3 files

**Option 2: Practice without audio**

## Philosophy

Audio is a tool, not a requirement. The practice is accessible without any resources beyond a timer. These are conveniences, not dependencies.
