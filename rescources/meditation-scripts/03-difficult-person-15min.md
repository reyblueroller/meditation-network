## Script

[Continuing from loved ones practice...]

Now we'll work with something more challenging...

[PAUSE: 8s]

This practice is optional... and it requires care...

[PAUSE: 10s]

We'll bring to mind someone we find difficult...

Not the most difficult person in your life... just someone mildly challenging...

[PAUSE: 12s]

This could be someone who irritates you... someone you're in conflict with...

Someone whose behavior troubles you...

[PAUSE: 10s]

But choose wisely... start small...

Not someone who's caused you deep harm...

[PAUSE: 8s]

If this feels too much today... you can stay with loved ones...

Or return to self-compassion... that's perfectly fine...

[PAUSE: 12s]

For those continuing... bring this person to mind gently...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Notice what happens in your body... your heart...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Perhaps there's tension... resistance... contraction...

That's completely natural... allow it...

[PAUSE: 12s]

Remember... this practice isn't about condoning harmful behavior...

It's not about becoming a doormat... or bypassing real hurt...

[PAUSE: 10s]

It's about freeing your own heart from the burden of resentment...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Consider this... this difficult person... like you... wants to be happy...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Like you... they're trying to avoid suffering...

[PAUSE: 8s]

They may be doing it unskillfully... causing harm...

But underneath... they're human... they struggle...

[PAUSE: 12s]

See if you can recognize this shared humanity...

Even just a little bit...

[PAUSE: 15s]

From a place of groundedness in your own heart...

See if you can offer even the smallest wish for their wellbeing...

[PAUSE: 10s]

If it helps... imagine them as a child... before life hardened them...

[PAUSE: 12s]

With whatever sincerity you can find... even 5%... offer these phrases...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

If resistance comes up... that's okay...

You can acknowledge it... "This is hard... and I'm trying anyway..."

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

This doesn't mean you have to spend time with this person...

Or trust them... or pretend everything is fine...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Compassion and boundaries can coexist...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May you be safe...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be healthy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be at ease...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May you be happy...

[PAUSE: 20s]

Notice any softening... even the tiniest shift in your heart...

This is the practice... this willingness to try...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Continuing silently... at your own pace...

Or if it feels too much... returning to self-compassion...

[PAUSE: 30s]

Now gently release the image of this difficult person...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Return your attention to yourself... to your own heart...

[PAUSE: 10s]

Acknowledge the courage it takes to practice in this way...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May I be safe...

May I be healthy...

May I be at ease...

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Rest in your own heart space... breathing... present...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Allowing whatever arose to settle...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Your heart... still here... still whole...

[PAUSE: 20s]

[Transition to silence or closing]

## Facilitator Notes

**Before this practice, say:**
"This next practice is optional. If working with a difficult person feels too much today, you can continue with loved ones, return to self-compassion, or simply rest in silence. Honor what you need."

**Important:**
- This is advanced practice - not for beginners
- Always offer self-compassion before and after
- Never push through if there's trauma activation
- Difficult person practice can be skipped entirely
- Some sessions may focus only on self and loved ones

**Signs to skip this practice:**
- Recent acute conflict
- Active trauma processing
- New to meditation
- Heart feels closed or overwhelmed

**The practice works when:**
- There's genuine readiness
- Self-compassion is established
- Person is mildly difficult (not severely harmful)
- Practitioner feels resourced

This is not spiritual bypassing.
Compassion doesn't mean accepting abuse.
Boundaries and kindness coexist.
