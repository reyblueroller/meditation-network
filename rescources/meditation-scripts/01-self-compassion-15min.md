## Script

[Continuing from grounding practice...]

Resting attention in the center of your chest... the area around your heart...

[PAUSE: 8s]

You might notice warmth... expansion... tightness... heaviness... fluttering... or perhaps very little...

Whatever's present... or not present... is fine...

[PAUSE: 10s]

This is the area we'll work with... offering yourself goodwill from here...

Not making anything happen... just setting an intention...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Bringing to mind an intention for your own wellbeing...

[PAUSE: 5s]

You can use these phrases... or different words that feel more natural...

[PAUSE: 5s]

As you hear each phrase... notice what happens in your chest area...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

These aren't demands... just intentions... like planting seeds...

[PAUSE: 8s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

If this feels awkward... or brings up resistance... that's a common response...

The resistance itself can be held with gentleness...

[PAUSE: 10s]

You can place your hand on your chest if that helps... a physical gesture of the intention...

[PAUSE: 8s]

Continuing with the phrases... at your own rhythm...

[PAUSE: 5s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Noticing what's happening in your chest... any warmth... softening... or perhaps no change yet...

All of these are just what's present...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 10s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 20s]

You're practicing an intention... developing a capacity... building a pattern...

[PAUSE: 10s]

A few more rounds... feeling the phrases in your heart...

[PAUSE: 5s]

May I be safe...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May I be healthy...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May I be at ease...

[PAUSE: 12s]

May I be happy...

[PAUSE: 20s]

Now letting the words fade...

Simply resting with whatever sensations are present in your chest...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Breathing... noticing... being here...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Allowing whatever has developed to settle in naturally...

[PAUSE: 15s]

Breathing naturally... attention in your chest area...

[PAUSE: 20s]

[Transition to next practice or silence]
